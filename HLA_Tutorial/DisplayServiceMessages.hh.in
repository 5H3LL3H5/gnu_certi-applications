HLA Tutorial\n\n\
This tutorial gives a brief introduction in the usage of the High Level \
Architecture Interface Specification 1.3. HLA is a standard for distributed \
computer simulation systems. The middleware implementing HLA is called Runtime \
Infrastructure (RTI).\n\
The API is separated in so called RTI ambassador services and federate \
ambassador services. The RTI ambassador services are provided by an \
RTIambassador object and are handled like normal method invocations. In \
contrast, federate ambassador services have to be implemented within the \
federate and can be regarded as a callback mechanism.\n\
Furthermore the services are divided in different management areas. This \
tutorial shows and explains the correct usage of essential API calls of \
the management areas Federation Management, Declaration Management and \
Object Management.\
    "
    
#define DS_MSG_FEDERATION_MANAGEMENT "\
Federation Management\n\n\
Services of this management area coordinate federation-wide activities \
such as creating or destroying federations and joining or resigning a \
federation. Federation-wide save and restore activities and synchronization \
operations are also supported. \
    "

#define DS_MSG_CREATE_FEDERATION_EXECUTION "\
Federation Management -> Create Federation Execution\n\n\
The RTI ambassador service createFederationExecution is usally invoked by the \
first federate. This service creates the federation specifed by a name and a \
file holding the federation object model (FOM). \
    "

#define DS_MSG_JOIN_FEDERATION_EXECUTION "\
Federation Management -> Join Federation Execution\n\n\
The RTI ambassador service joinFederationExecution is used by a federate to \
join an existing federation. Input parameters are his own name, the federation \
name of the federation it wants to join and a pointer to its federate \
ambassador implementation. \

#define DS_MSG_RESIGN_FEDERATION_EXECUTION "\
Federation Management -> Resign Federation Execution\n\n\
The RTI ambassador service resignFederationExecution is used by a federate \
when leaving the federation. \

#define DS_MSG_DESTROY_FEDERATION_EXECUTION "\
Federation Management -> Destroy Federation Execution\n\n\
The RTI ambassador service destroyFederationExecution is usally invoked \
by the last federate. This service destroys the current federation \
execution. \
