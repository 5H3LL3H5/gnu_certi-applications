HLA_TestsSuite is a set of [possibly] small program which may be used to HLA 
conformance testing.
The set of test programs are provided by many CERTI developers and contributors
see https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects.

We are currently far away for full conformance testing suite but with the help 
of the community we may end-up with a full test suite which may be suitable for 
CERTI conformance and non-regression tests and may be for any RTI.
