This is an HLA tutorial using CERTI (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi)

                   INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNIX like system.
                   =================================

1. HOW TO USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS
================================
Better is to make a copy of this file into a new file like this :
         cp HLA_Tutorial_DESCRIPTION.txt MYHLATD.txt
and now modify this new file (MYHLATD.txt) by replacing all :

TPHLADIR =============> where you find all TP_HLA applications
                        (you will find applications directory) 
RUNCERTIDIR ==========> where you find install directory of CERTI
                        (you will find /bin /include /lib /share)
HOSTRIG ==============> name of the host running rtig

2. CERTI VERIFICATION. 
======================
   2.1. check your CERTI installation or install it in RUNCERTIDIR
        At this point <ls RUNCERTIDIR> will give :
                      bin/  include/  lib/  share/

   2.2. setup all environment variables to point to CERTI installation.
       If you use shell like (as bash)         do :
       source RUNCERTIDIR/share/scripts/myCERTI_env.sh  HOSTRTIG

       If you use cshell like (as csh or tcsh) do :
       source RUNCERTIDIR/share/scripts/myCERTI_env.csh HOSTRTIG

       At this point <which rtig> will find rtig in correct place

3. BUILDING TUTORIAL
====================
   3.1. If you read this file you have got the TUTORIAL in TPHLADIR isn'it ?
   3.2. cd TPHLADIR/applications/HLA_Tutorial
   3.3  mkdir build_CERTI_TUTORIAL
   3.4. cd build_CERTI_TUTORIAL
   3.5. cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=TPHLADIR ../.
   3.6  make
   3.7  make install

4. RUNNING TUTORIAL
===================
   4.1 Launch rtig on HOSTRIG :
       cd TPHLADIR/share/federations
       rtig
   4.2 Launch controller ( if on host different of HOST don't forget ยง2.2) :
       ./TPHLADIR/bin/controllerFederate
       It runs and wait on >> Press any key to resume <<
   4.3 Launch process    ( if on host different of HOST don't forget ยง2.2) :
       ./TPHLADIR/bin/processFederate
       It runs and says <Wait for second federate>
   4.4 Return to controller launch window and press any key and return
       and you see what happens step by step, 
       don't forget to press any key and return when required.

Use without moderation....and don't forget to stop rtig before go home.
