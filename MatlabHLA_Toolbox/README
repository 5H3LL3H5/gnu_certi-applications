#  Compiling/Installation   #
#############################

After installing CERTI do make && make install. After that rti.mexglx is
compiled and all m-files are copied to the MatlabHLA13 directory.

It is recommended to copy the FED files in the federation directory manually
to /usr/local/share/federations.

To use the toolbox properly add the MatlabHLA13 directory to your Matlab path.
