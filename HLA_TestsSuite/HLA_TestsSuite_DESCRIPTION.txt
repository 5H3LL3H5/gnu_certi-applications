HLA_TestsSuite is a set of [possibly] small programs which may be used to HLA 
conformance testing.
The set of test programs are provided by many CERTI developers and contributors
see https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi.

We are currently far away for full conformance testing suite but with the help 
of the community we may end-up with a full tests suite which may be suitable for 
CERTI conformance and non-regression tests and may be for any RTI.

The test suite should be build using CMake.
The whole test suite may be launched using 
CTest (http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Testing_With_CTest)
and 
DTest (http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/tsp/dtest/what_is_dtest.pdf)

The method is simple:

1) build HLA_TestsSuite using CMake
2) install dtest (http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/tsp/dtest/)
3) eventually update your Python PATH if you did 
   not install dtest globally (or you don't have the right to do so)
   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dtest
4) make test
   which should gives something like:

$ make test
