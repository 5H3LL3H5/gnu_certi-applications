# Here we will generate the DisplayServiceMessages.hh include file
# from DisplayServiceMessages.hh.in file.
#
# The resulting file contains all messages displayed by the 
# display service.
# This file is generated in order to ease it's update
# (or even later translation)
#
# There is a 2 steps: 
#   - first we run some scripts in order to extract some source line
#     of code
#   - then we generate the header file using CMake CONFIGURE_FILE 
#     which basically does var replacement.
#
# This generation currently works only on Unix 
# on other platform we just use the provided header file
# (which may not be up to date)
