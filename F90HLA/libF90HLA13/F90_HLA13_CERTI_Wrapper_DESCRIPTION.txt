Today HLA is the state of the art standard for distributed simulation. 

This library provides engineers an easy way to extent existing 
Fortran programs to so-called federates. Because HLA do not have an
Fortran API this library tries to fill the gap.

If you start writing a Fortran application copy the file fedSrvMod.f90
in your application directory. Extent the function stubs of the federate
services to your needed functionality and remove unneeded federate 
services. Obviously, the file fedSrvMod.f90 is part of your application
code.

For further details have a look at the supplied demo applications.

All software parts are developed by using CERTI (www.cert.fr/CERTI). 
The usage of this RTI is recommended.
